Instructions to create a layout to spawn windows in selected workspaces and with the selected dimensions.
First of all create the layout you want in each workspace and go inside this folder. Then use the two scripts "extract_canvas" to extract a
JSON file that contains all the informations about your windows in each workspace and "induce_rules" to use the JSON file to generate the rules to use with the bspc
command.
By the way, I made a script "layout.sh" that do what I said before so, once you've made your layout launch ONLY this script; then put in the "layout.init" file all
the programs you want to launch.
Then go to sxhkdrc and made a keybind (I made 'alt + shift + s') and you've done!

P.S. Every problem you notice about this repository please contact me.
